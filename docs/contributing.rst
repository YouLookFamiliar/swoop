Contributing
============

Your contributions are appreciated!

These guidelines are here to help you prepare your pull-requests and
other contributions to this project. Code contributions require a
specific process to be followed; this is important and so this is the
first topic that we will go over.

Code Contributions
------------------

Generally, this is the process you should follow:

- Run the test suite and check if it passes. Tests shouldn’t fail on
  master but it can happen. This may indicate that there are
  dependencies missing or there’s something else wrong with your
  installation.
- Branch off from master.
- Make your contributions; one commit per feature or issue is a good
  guideline. Add new tests or adapt existing ones as necessary; ensure
  that they pass.
- Submit a pull request.
